# MODULE 1: Overview of Cloud Computing

## LESSON 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

### Definition and essential characteristics of cloud computing

1. 5 Essential characteristics
   - On demand self-service
   - Broad Network access
   - REsource Pooling
     - Economies of scale
     - cost-efficient
     - Resources dynamically assigned based on demand
   - Rapid Elasticity
     - Access resources when needed and release when don't need
   - Measured Service
     - Pay for what used (utilization)

Cloud Computing as a Service (CssA) using technology as a service; leveraging remote system on-demand over internet

2. 3 Cloud Deployment Models

   - Public
   - Private
   - Hybrid

3. 3 Service Models

   - Three layers in computing stack:
     - Infrastructure(IaaS),
     - Platform,(PaaS)
     - Application(SaaS)

### A brief history and evolution of cloud

### Key considerations for cloud computing

- Agility
- Flexibility
- Competitiveness

1. Infrastructure and workloads -> Cost saving by pay as you go
2. SaaS and development platforms
3. SPeed and Productivity

### Key cloud service providers and their services

- Aliyun
- AWS
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- IBM Cloud

# MODULE 2: Cloud Computing Models

## LESSON 1: Service Models

### Overview of cloud service models

1. IaaS: Leasing

   - IaaS Cloud Provide manages physical resources, data centers, cooling power, network and security, computing resources

2. PaaS: Renting
   - PaaS Cloud provider manager the platform infrasture, including: Operating system (OS), Development tools, Dtabases, Business Analytics
3. SaaS: Uber
   - SaaS cloud provider also manages and hosts: applications, data

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service

* A form of cloud computing that delivers fundamentals: compute, network, storage to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay as you go basis.
* IaaS providers host INF components present in on premises data center and virtualization or hypervisor layer
* Customers create VMs, with abilities to track and monitor the performance and usage of their cloud services, and manage disaster recover
* IaaS Key components:
    * Physical data centers (physical machines)
    * Compute
    * Network: access virtually or through API
    * Storage: object storage
* Applications of IaaS
    * Test and development
        * set up test/dev. faster
        * help developer focusing on business logic than infrasture management
    * Business Coninuity and Disaster Recovery
        * make applications and data accessable during a disaster or outage
    * Faster Deployments and Scaling    
        * Deploy faster
        * Scale infrasture up and down as demand fluctuates
    * High performance computings
        * Solve complex problems involing millions of variables and calculations
        * weather prediction, financial modeling
    * Big Data Analysis
        * Patterns, trends, assocaitions requires huge amount of processing power
        * Cloud computing provide high performance and make it economically viable
* IaaS Concerns
    * Lack of transparency
    * dependency on third party

### Platform-as-a-Service

* PaaS: a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete platform to develop deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third party
* PaaS provider host and manage:
    * Servers
    * Networks
    * Storage
    * Operating systems
    * Application runtimes
    * APIS
    * Middleware
    * Databases
    * provider also responsible for installation, configuration, operation of application infrasture
        * User only responsible for application codes and maintainance
* IaaS provider offers access to raw computing resources: servers, storage, networking; Users responsible for the platform and application

* PaaS Characteristics:
    * high level of abstraction
        * Eliminate complexity of deploying applications
    * Support services and APIS
    * Run time environments
        * Excute codes according to application owner and cloud provider policies
    * Rapid deployment mechanisms
    * Middleware capabilities
        * supppor a range of application infrastructure capabilities
* Use cases:
    * API development and management
    * IoT
    * Business analytics and intelligences
    * Business Process Management 
    * Master data management
* Advantages:
    * Scalability
    * Faster time to market
    * greater agility and innovation
* Risks:
    * Information security threats
    * Dependency on service providers infrastructure
    * Customer lack control over changes in strategy, service offerings, or tools


### Software-as-a-Service
* SaaS is a cloud offering that provides access to a service provider's cloud based software
* SasS providers maintains: 
    * Servers
    * Databases
    * Application codes
    * security
* SaaS providers manage application:
    * Security
    * Availability
    * Performance
* SaaS supports:
    * Email and collaboration: office, gmail
    * Customer relationship mgt.: saleforce ...
    * human resource mgt. workda, SAP, etc
    * Financial mgt.
* Key characteristics
    * Multitenant architecture
    * Mng. privileges and monitor data
    * security, compliance, maintenance
    * customize applications
    * subscription model
    * scalable resources
* Key benefits:
    * Greatly reduce the time from decision to value
    * Increase workforce productivity and efficiency
        * users can access core business apps from anywhere
        * buy and deploy apps in minutes
    * Spread out software cost over time
* Use Cases:
    * Reduce on premises IT infrastructure and capital expenditures
    * avoid on going upgrades, maintenances, patching
    * run application with minimal input
    * manage websites, marketing, sales, etc
    * Gain resilience and business continuity of cloud provider
* COncerns:
    * Data ownership and safety
    * Third party maintains business critical data
    * needs good internet connection
