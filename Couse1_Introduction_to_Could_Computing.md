# MODULE 1: Overview of Cloud Computing  

## LESSON 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing 

### Definition and essential characteristics of cloud computing

1. 5 Essential characteristics
    * On demand self-service
    * Broad Network access
    * REsource Pooling
        * Economies of scale
        * cost-efficient
        * Resources dynamically assigned based on demand
    * Rapid Elasticity
        * Access resources when needed and release when don't need
    * Measured Service
        * Pay for what used (utilization)

Cloud Computing as a Service (CssA) using technology as a service; leveraging remote system on-demand over internet

2. 3 Cloud Deployment Models
    * Public
    * Private
    * Hybrid

3. 3 Service Models 

    * Three layers in computing stack: 
        * Infrastructure(IaaS), 
        * Platform,(PaaS) 
        * Application(SaaS)
